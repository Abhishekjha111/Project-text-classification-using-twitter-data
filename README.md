##### Problem Statement company X identifies ADRs (adverse drug reactions) after a drug’s release. Comprehensive knowledge of ADRs can reduce the detrimental impact on patient’s health system. Practically, clinical trials cannot investigate all settings in which a drug will be used, making it impossible to fully characterize the drug’s adverse effect profile before its approval. company X methods continuously analyse frequently updated data sources, Twitter in particularly because of its large user base, demographic variability, and publicly available data.     ADR detection in social media requires automated methods to process the high data volume. It would greatly help if is able to automate the segmentation of Tweet into either ADR or NON-ADR, on the basis of Drug, Symptom and Effect mentioned in future.
